        <h4> <h3> You're An</h3>
        <h4>INTP!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Thinker</h5>
 		<p>
		INTP types are quiet, thoughtful, analytical individuals who tend to spend long periods of time on 
		their own, working through problems and forming solutions. They are curious about systems and how 
		things work. Consequently, they are frequently found in service areas dealing with science, 
		architecture, and law. INTPs tend to be less at ease in social situations or in the "caring 
		vocations," although they enjoy the company of those who share their interests. They also tend to be 
		impatient with the bureaucracy, rigid hierarchies, and the politics prevalent in some outreaches. 
		They prefer to work informally with others as equals.
		</p>
		<p>
		INTPs organize their understanding of any topic by articulating principles, and they are 
		especially drawn to theoretical constructs. Having articulated these principles for themselves,
		 they can demonstrate remarkable skill in explaining complex ideas to others in simple terms, 
		 especially in writing. On the other hand, their ability to grasp complexity may also lead 
		 them to provide overly detailed explanations of "simple" ideas, and listeners may judge that 
		 the INTP makes things more difficult than they are. To the INTP, however, this is 
		 incomprehensible: They are merely presenting all the information. The NT (Intuitive Thinker) 
		 of the INTP is what makes their hearts so strongly committed to social justice issues, 
		 although the I (Introverted) side of them might make this less visible to the onlooker. 
		</p>
		<p>
		INTPs may be called to vocations where they can use their logical and analytical abilities.  
		NTs also tend to prefer to focus on learning rather than feeling. Given their independent nature, 
		INTPs may prefer working alone to leading or following in a group. They can use their gifts to 
		bring order to outreaches carefully analyze an idea for its flaws before committing to moving 
		forward with it. They have the gift of being able to see the long-range vision of things and 
		will try as hard as they can to take an objective approach. This also puts them in a good 
		place to delegate the tasks required to get a goal accomplished, although an INTP would rather 
		not spend their time directly supervising the implementation. Their NT temperament also drives 
		them to seek out challenges and they prove to be great assets in outreaches who may not have 
		the most resources on hand. NTs are very grateful when their work is appreciated by others.
		</p>
		<p>
		During interactions with others, if INTPs are focused on gathering information, they may seem 
		detached, oblivious, aloof, or even rebellious-when in fact they are concentrating on listening 
		and understanding. However, INTPs' extraverted intuition often gives them a quick wit, 
		especially with language. They may defuse tension through comical observations and references. 
		They can be charming, even in their quiet reserve, and are sometimes surprised by the high 
		esteem in which their friends and members of their ministry hold them. When INTPs feel insulted,
		 however, they may respond with sudden, cutting criticism. After such an incident, INTPs are 
		 likely to be as bewildered as the recipient. They have broken the rules of debate and exposed 
		 their raw emotions. To INTPs, this is the crux of the problem: emotions must be dealt with 
		 logically - because improperly handled emotions, INTPs believe, can only harm.
