 <h5>"The Artist"</h5>
 		<p>
        According to Myers-Briggs, ISFPs are peaceful, easygoing people who adopt a "live and let live" approach 
        to life. They enjoy taking things at their own pace and tend to live in the moment. Although quiet, they 
        are pleasant, considerate, and caring, devoted to the people in their lives. They are very perceptive and 
        are gifted in their ability to be aware of others.  Because of their tendency to live in the moment, ISFPs 
        are great listeners who can retain all types of specific information about people.  These observations 
        allow them to form remarkably accurate perceptions of people.  It may be difficult to get to know an ISFP 
        because they can hold back their opinions and ideas but they are very interested in making deeper 
        connections to people, especially through service to others.  They are very much at peace showing their 
        love through their actions rather than expressing them verbally.  As an SP individual, they are great 
        negotiators and are gifted with an ability to approach even the most testing situations with Christ-like 
        diplomacy.
		</p>
		<p>
		An ISFP's values are important to them.  They constantly strive to make sure that they are living their 
		lives in accordance to these values, and an ISFP will quickly become resistant to something that they 
		feel violates that.  They are action-oriented individuals, and in those actions they try to work towards 
		goals that fall in line with their personal values.  An ideal work environment for an ISFP is one where 
		they can participate in experiential learning.  They can grow easily bored with traditional methods of 
		distanced and theoretical analysis.  This is because they filter information through their value system 
		and strive to search for personal and underlying meaning. An ISFP works well without restrictions and 
		would rather not be in charge of others or be controlled herself.  They are hard workers who hold 
		themselves to a high standard without looking for praise and affirmation from others.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Perhaps the greatest gift of an ISFP is their artistic ability.  They are blessed with a vision that 
		recognizes the beauty through nature and life.  The have a strong appreciation for art and love the idea 
		of creating it themselves.  They are very keen to what interacts with the senses and, given their strong 
		commitment to serving othere, they will work extremely hard on artistic projects.
