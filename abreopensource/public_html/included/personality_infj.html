        <h4>INFJ!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Protector</h5>
 		<p>
        INFJs are conscientious and value-driven. They seek meaning in relationships, ideas, and events, with an 
        eye toward better understanding themselves and others. Using their intuitive skills, they develop a clear 
        vision, which they then execute decisively to better the lives of others. Like their INTJ counterparts, 
        INFJs regard problems as opportunities to design and implement creative solutions.
		</p>
		<p>
		INFJs are quiet, private individuals who prefer to exercise their influence behind the scenes. Although 
		very independent, INFJs are intensely interested in the well-being of others. INFJs prefer one-on-one 
		relationships to large groups. Sensitive and complex, they are adept at understanding complicated issues 
		and driven to resolve differences in a cooperative and creative manner. The NF (iNtuitive and Feeling) 
		side of an INFJ gives them the gift of a rigorous idealism that helps them constantly search for new and 
		more intentional ways to stay faithful to a cause and becoming better at meeting the needs of people that 
		are being served in a ministry or church.
		</p>
		<p>
		INFJs have a rich, vivid inner life, which they may be reluctant to share with those around them. 
		Nevertheless, they are congenial in their interactions, and perceptive of the emotions of others. 
		Generally well-liked by their peers, they may often be considered close friends and confidants by most 
		other types. However, they are guarded in expressing their own feelings, especially to new people, and 
		so tend to establish close relationships slowly. INFJs tend to be easily hurt, though they may not reveal 
		this except to their closest companions. INFJs may "silently withdraw as a way of setting limits," rather
		 than expressing their wounded feelings-a behavior that may leave others confused and upset.
		</p>
		<p>
		INFJs tend to be sensitive, quiet leaders with a great depth of personality. They are intricately and 
		deeply woven, mysterious, and highly complex, sometimes puzzling even to themselves. They have an orderly 
		view toward the world, but are internally arranged in a complex way that only they can understand. 
		Abstract in communicating, they live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities. With a natural 
		affinity for art, INFJs tend to be creative and easily inspired. Yet they may also do well in the 
		sciences, aided by their intuition.
