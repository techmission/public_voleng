        <h4>ENFJ!</h4>

 <h5>The Giver</h5>
 		<p>
          Extraverted feeling types seek continuity through harmonious relationships and collective values. 
          They excel at picking up on the tone of a situation and acting accordingly, adding warmth to a cool 
          setting or turning sour into sweet. They naturally seek to know what people do well, what they enjoy, 
          and where and how they work. They seem to have an infinite number of acquaintances from all walks of 
          life and are always on the lookout for people in need and those who can help out. ENFJs weave and 
          strengthen the collective fabric of social conventions and interactions. Inclusiveness is important 
          and they are particularly sensitive to those who are excluded. 
		</p>
		<p>
		ENFJs focus on others, feeling a glow when those around them are happy, and troubled when something is 
		amiss. They are natural cheerleaders, often expressing support, gratitude, and encouragement, and heaping 
		praise onto those they appreciate. They take note of what is being done and what needs doing, offering 
		their assistance wherever necessary. The spirituality of an EF (Extraverted and Feeling) grows the most 
		when their efforts are directed where human needs are the greatest.  The NF (iNtuitive and Feeling) side 
		of an ENFJ gives them the gift of a rigorous idealism that helps them constantly search for new and more 
		intentional ways to stay faithful to a cause and becoming better at meeting the needs of people that are 
		being served in a ministry or church.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENFJs enjoy organizing group activities and tend to take their commitments seriously. In general, they are 
		reliable and do not like to disappoint others. As team players and project leaders, they have a gift for
		 rallying their players, focusing on what is being done right and each member's strengths. They are loyal 
		 and they expect loyalty. They carry conversations well, finding common ground with their speaker. They 
		 tend to find the correct and gracious way to respond in any given situation, no matter how tense or 
		 uncomfortable it is. NFs are also very enthusiastic, understanding, and optimistic.  They are great 
		 listeners who are gifted counselors and are highly committed to helping others through compassion. Their
		 gift for affirming others and appreciating affirmations give by others is very important for a ministry.
		 They fit nicely in the role of program leader in a Christian ministry and are great educators.  
		 Extraverted NFs are also gifted public speakers because of their ability to orate to the hearts of 
		 their audience.  
		</p>
		<p>
		EF (Extraverted feeling) types will uphold a wide range of values, simply because shared values are what 
		create harmony. Some will profess the importance of tough-minded logic, justice and scholarly debate 
		because their environments have these shared values. They tend to adopt the collective values of those 
		in their social group.  Because of the NFs gift of using creative imagination, they may be drawn to 
		Augustinian type prayers that transpose the words of the Scripture to our present situation.
