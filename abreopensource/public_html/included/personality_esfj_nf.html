        <h4> <h3> You're An</h3>
        <h4>ESFJ!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>"The Caregiver"</h5>
              <p>ESFJs focus on the outside world and assess their 
                experiences subjectively. They largely base their judgments on 
                their belief system and on the effects of actions on people. ESFJs 
                are literal and concrete, trusting the specific, factual information 
                gathered through their physiological senses.</p>
              
                <p>
                ESFJs project warmth through a genuine interest in the 
                well-being of others. They are often skilled at bringing out the best 
                in people, and they want to understand other points of view. They
                are serious about their responsibilities, seeing what needs to be 
                done and then doing it.
                </p>
               <p>  
              Easily hurt, ESFJs seek approval. They take pleasure in 
                other people's happiness. They give generously but expect 
                appreciation in return. As expert people readers, ESFJs often 
                adapt their manner to meet the expectations of others. However, 
                they have difficulty recognizing the shortcomings of loved ones.
               </p>
               <p>
                ESFJs tend to be vocal in expressing their sense of right and 
                wrong. Their value system derives from the external standards 
                defined by their community, as opposed to a personal set of ethics.                
               </p>
                <p>
                ESFJs seek structured, controlled environments, and tend 
                to be good at creating a sense of order. They generally feel 
                insecure in an atmosphere of uncertainty. They value the rule of 
                law and expect the same of others. ESFJs may be less interested 
                in understanding the concepts behind the rules, tending to shy 
                away from the abstract and impersonal.
