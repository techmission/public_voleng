 <h5>"The Doer"</h5>
 		<p>
        ESTPs are hands-on learners who live in the moment, seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with 
        their friends. The ESTP is open to situations, able to improvise to bring about desired results. 
		</p>
		<p>
		One of an ESTPs greatest gifts if their ability to sense and perceive people's feelings, motivations, 
		and attitudes.  They are very vigilant and are able to discover what is on people's hearts beyond what 
		their words express.  If they sense that a person is in need, an ESTPs natural response is to do whatever 
		they can to help, and do it now.  They are known for their open-mindedness and because of this people 
		tend to enjoy an ENTPs company.  While they may be flexible, ESTPs do have a very strong sense of right 
		and wrong and will stick to their principles very firmly.  As an SP (Sensing-Perceiving) individual, 
		they are great negotiator and are gifted with an ability to approach even the most testing situations 
		with diplomacy.
		</p>
		<p>
		ESTPs are active people who want to solve their problems rather than simply discuss them. They have a 
		flexible and adaptable mentality and dynamic approach to solving problems, and people tend to feel more 
		comfortable following the lead of an ESTP.  As SP temperament loves action and is easily put off by the 
		status quo.  This coupled with their strong sense of right and wrong leads ESTPs to be the most active 
		member of the community in terms of calling for justice.  Because of their 
		enthusiasm and high energy, ENTPs are happiest when they can serve in a quickly changing environment, 
		such as crisis response, where their constant supply of energy is greatly needed. They have the ability 
		to motivate others and their excitement about life and work can often be contagious.  They are good at 
		getting the ball rolling on a task, although they usually aren't the best in the outreach at 
		following through with tasks every step of the way.
