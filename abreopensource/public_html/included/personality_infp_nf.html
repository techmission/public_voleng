        <h4>INFP!</h4>

 <h5>The Idealist</h5>
 		<p>
        The polite, reserved exterior of INFPs can at first make them difficult to get to know. They enjoy 
        conversation, however, taking particular delight in the unusual. When INFPs are in a sociable mood, 
        their humor and charm shine through. Disposed to like people and to avoid conflict, INFPs tend to make 
        pleasant company.
		</p>
		<p>
		Devoted to those in their inner circle, INFPs guard the emotional well-being of others, consoling those 
		in distress. Guided by their desire for harmony, INFPs prefer to be flexible unless their ethics are 
		violated. Then, they become passionate advocates for their beliefs.  The core of an INFP's strength comes 
		from their strongly held core convictions that they may or may not talk about on a regular basis. They 
		are often able to sway the opinions of others through tact, diplomacy, and an ability to see varying 
		sides of an issue.
		</p>
		<p>
		INFPs develop these insights through reflection, and they require substantial time alone to ponder and 
		process new information. While they can be quite patient with complex material, they are generally bored 
		by routine. Though not always organized, INFPs are meticulous about things they value. Perfectionists, 
		they may have trouble completing a task because it cannot meet their high standards. They may even go 
		back to a completed project after the deadline so they can improve it.
		</p>
		<p>
		INFPs are creative types and often have a gift for language. As introverts, they may prefer to express 
		themselves through writing. Their dominant Feeling drives their desire to communicate, while their 
		auxiliary intuition supplies the imagination. Having a talent for symbolism, they enjoy metaphors and 
		similes. They continually seek new ideas and adapt well to change. They prefer working in an environment 
		that values these gifts and allows them to make a positive difference in the world, according to their 
		personal beliefs.
