        <h4>ENTP!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Visionary</h5>
 		<p>
        At their best, people with ENTP preferences constantly scan the environment for opportunities and 
        possibilities.  ENTPs are quick to see complex interrelationships between people, things, and ideas.
         They are immensely gifted at generating conceptual possibilities and then analysing them 
         strategically. ENTPs are good at understanding how systems work and are enterprising and resourceful 
         in maneuvering within them to achieve their ends.  This gift coupled with their extroverted nature gives 
         them the title of the "enthusiastic innovator" who is frequently described as clever, cerebrally and 
         verbally quick, outgoing, flexible, loyal and resourceful. Their world is full of possibilities, 
         interesting concepts and exciting challenges. They are stimulated by difficulties, quickly devising 
         creative responses and plunging into activity, trusting their ability to improvise. They use their 
         Intuition primarily externally and enjoy exercising ingenuity in the world. ENTPs are likely to be 
         imaginative and can bring a lot of creativity to an outreach.  
		</p>
		<p>
		ENTPs use their Thinking function primarily internally to analyse situations and their own ideas and to 
		plan. They admire competence, intelligence, precision and efficiency. ENTPs are usually Analytical, 
		logical, rational and objective.  They can also be assertive and questioning because of their theoretical, 
		conceptual and curious approach to life.  The NT (Intuitive Thinker) part of them tends to prefer to 
		focus on learning 
		rather than feeling.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENTPs are enterprising, resourceful, active and energetic. They respond to challenging problems by creating
		 complex and global solutions. They are usually adept at "reading" other people, seeing how to motivate 
		 them and assuming leadership in times of chaos.The NT of the INTP is what makes their hearts so strongly 
		 committed to social justice issues, and the E (extraverted) part of them helps communicate that passion 
		 and help motivate the hearts of those around them.  They can do almost anything that captures their 
		 interest and they don't take the comment "you can't do this" as a limitation, but rather as a personal 
		 challenge and will spare no expense to discover a solution to.  However, they are less interested in 
		 generating and following through with detailed plans than in generating ideas and possibilities. Their NT 
		 temperament drives them to seek out challenges and they prove to be great assets in outreaches who may 
		 not have many resources on hand. NTs are very grateful when their work is appreciated by others.  It is not uncommon for an ENTP to feel called to face another challenge once they've figured 
		 out a strategy for the current one. Nonetheless, when ENTPs are used correctly in an outreach, they offer 
		 deep understanding and a high degree of flexibility and problem-solving ability.
