        <h4>ESFP!</h4>

 <h5>"The Performer</h5>
 		<p>
        ESFPs live in the moment, experiencing life to the fullest. They enjoy people, as well as material 
        comforts. Rarely allowing conventions to interfere with their lives, they find creative ways to meet 
        human needs. ESFPs are excellent team players, focused on completing the task at hand with maximum fun 
        and minimum discord. Active types, they find pleasure in new experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
		ESFPs take a hands-on approach in most things. Because they learn more by doing than by studying or 
		reading, they tend to rush into things, learning by interacting with their environment. They usually 
		dislike theory and written explanations. Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs, although they
		 tend to do well when the subject of study interests them, or when they see the relevance of a subject 
		 and are allowed to interact with people.
		</p>
		<p>
		Observant, practical, realistic, and specific, ESFPs make decisions according to their own personal 
		standards. They use their Feeling judgment internally to identify and empathize with others. Naturally 
		attentive to the world around them, ESFPs are keen observers of human behavior. They quickly sense what 
		is happening with other people and immediately respond to their individual needs. They are especially 
		good at mobilizing people to deal with crises. Generous, optimistic, and persuasive, they are good at 
		interpersonal interactions. They often play the role of peacemaker due to their warm, sympathetic, and 
		tactful nature.
		</p>
		<p>
		ESFPs love being around people and having new experiences. Living in the here-and-now, they often do 
		not think about long term effects or the consequences of their actions. While very practical, they 
		generally despise routines, instead desiring to 'go with the flow.' They are, in fact, very play minded. 
		Because ESFPs learn better through hands-on experience, classroom learning may be troublesome for many of 
		them, especially those with a very underdeveloped intuitive side.
		</p>
		<p>
		Others usually see ESFPs as resourceful and supportive, as well as gregarious, playful, and spontaneous. 
		ESFPs get a lot of satisfaction out of life and are fun to be around. Their exuberance and enthusiasm draw 
		others to them. They are flexible, adaptable, congenial, and easygoing. They seldom plan ahead, trusting 
		their ability to respond in the moment and deal effectively with whatever presents itself. They dislike 
		structure and routine and will generally find ways to bend the rules
