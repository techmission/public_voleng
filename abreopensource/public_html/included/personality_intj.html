 <h5>The Strategist</h5>
 		<p>
        INTJs are analytical. Like INTPs, they are most comfortable working alone and tend to be less sociable 
        than other types. Nevertheless, INTJs are prepared to lead if no one else seems up to the task, or if they 
        see a major weakness in the current leadership. They tend to be pragmatic, logical, and creative. They 
        have a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are not generally susceptible to catchphrases 
        and do not recognize authority based on tradition, rank, or title.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hallmarks of the INTJ include independence of thought and a desire for efficiency. They work best when 
		given autonomy and creative freedom. They harbor an innate desire to express themselves by conceptualizing 
		their own intellectual designs. They have a talent for analyzing and formulating complex theories. INTJs
		 are generally well-suited for vocations within academia, research, management, psychology, engineering,
		  and law ministries. The NT (Intuitive Thinker) of the INTP is what makes their hearts so strongly 
		  committed to social justice issues, although the I (Introverted) side of them might make this less 
		  visible to the onlooker.
		</p>
		<p>
		
		They are often acutely aware of their own knowledge and abilities - as well as their limitations and what they 
		don't know (a quality that tends to distinguish them from INTPs). INTJs thus develop a strong confidence in their 
		ability and talents, making them natural leaders.  However, the introverted nature of INTJs will produce a more 
		reflective leadership style where designing is a much more desirable task than implementation.  Because of this, 
		INTJs can bring their strengths to long-range planning committees within a ministry or congregation. Their NT 
		temperament also drives them to seek out challenges and they prove to be great assets in ministries who may not
 		have the most resources on hand. NTs are very grateful when their work is appreciated by other Christians.
		</p>
		<p>
		In forming relationships INTJs tend to seek out others with similar character traits and ideologies. 
		Agreement on theoretical concepts is an important aspect of their relationships. By nature INTJs can be 
		demanding in their expectations, and they approach relationships in a rational manner.  They tend to be 
		stable, reliable, and dedicated. Harmony in relationships and home life tends to be extremely important 
		to them. They generally withhold strong emotion and do not like to waste time with what they consider 
		irrational social rituals. This may cause non-INTJs to perceive them as distant and reserved.
