         According to Myers-Briggs, ISTPs excel at analyzing situations to reach the heart of a problem so that 
         they can swiftly implement a functional repair, making them ideally suited to the field of engineering. 
         Naturally quiet people, they are interested in understanding how systems operate, focusing on efficient 
         operation and structure. They are open to new information and approaches. But contrary to their seemingly 
         detached natures, ISTPs are often capable of humorously insightful observations about the world around 
         them.  As an SP (Sensing-Perceiving) person, their introverted nature can often give way to their thirst 
         for activity, humor, and bringing a light-hearted air to a room full of people.

		An ISTP has a strong sense of loyalty: to their friends and loved ones and also to their causes and 
		beliefs.  They strive for justice and share the prophetic vision that everyone should be treated with 
		equity and fairness.  ISTPs do not care too much for rigid systems of governance, but instead hold their 
		own high standards for behavior and tend to reject taking part in anything that may go against their 
		personal standards.  Because of how strongly they hold their own personal values, ISTPs are never quick to 
		judge the personal values of another.  An ISTP looks for the most impartial way to make a decision, and 
		can easily put their own feelings aside, and sometimes the feelings of others, in order to make the best 
		decision they believe possible.  They do do try to do this with tact, though.  As an SP individual, they 
		are great negotiators and are gifted with an ability to approach even the most testing situations with 
		Christ-like diplomacy. They must, however, be careful not to confuse an emotional response with a value 
		judgement, as the two can often seem to run parallel in the eyes of an ISTP.
		</p>

		The ISTP temperament isn't content sitting around watching the action occur.  They need to be the ones 
		out making the action occur. One of an ISTP's greatest gifts and strengths is their ability to carry out 
		the important actions.  Within a ministry, the ST (Sensing and Thinking) gifts make them likely to be the 
		most willing to take on any task that they are needed to accomplish.  Shutting out distractions, they take 
		a practical, logical approach to their endeavors. Realistic and responsible, they work steadily toward 
		their goals..  They tend to be very gifted in technical fields, due to their focus on the smallest of 
		details to produce practical and tangible results.  Because of their love for action and attention to 
		detail, they are much more likely to enjoy a role as an implementer rather than a long-range planner 
		in a ministry.  As an SP temperament, they works best when not tied down by rules.  An ISTP can be a 
		very important person in a crisis response or disaster relief situation, using their gift to swiftly 
		analyze a situation and find the best way to bring order to a messy situation.  Their active nature makes 
		them a good candidate to be a leader of a church or ministry's athletic team.  An ISTP coach is likely to 
		find practices cumbersome, but will be a great asset in the heat of competition.
