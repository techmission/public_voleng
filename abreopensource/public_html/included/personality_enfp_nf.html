        <h4>ENFP!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Inspirer</h5>
 		<p>
              ENFPs are initiators of change, keenly perceptive of possibilities. They energize and stimulate 
              others through their contagious enthusiasm.  ENFPs are known for being warm, bright and able to 
              anticipate the needs of others and to offer them needed help and appreciation. They bring zest, 
              joy, liveliness, and fun to all aspects of their lives. They tend to idealize people, and can be 
              disappointed when reality fails to fulfill their expectations. 
		</p>
		<p>
		An ENFP has a strong sense of values and principles and strives to make sure that all that they do in 
		their lives are in line with these values.  The NF (iNtuitive and Feeling) side of an ENFP gives them the 
		gift of a rigorous idealism that helps them constantly search for new and more intentional ways to stay 
		faithful to a cause and becoming better at meeting the needs of people that are being served in an outreasch.
	  EF (Extraverted feeling) types will uphold a wide 
		 range of values, simply because shared values are what create harmony. Some will profess the importance 
		 of tough-minded logic, justice and scholarly debate because their environments have these shared values.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENFPs have a lot of charisma and they tend to bring this with them to outreach.  They are at their best
		 in situations that are fluid and changing, and that allow them to express their creativity and use their 
		 charisma.  They also have the ability to see opportunities that other members of the outreach may miss or overlook and then use their gift of charisma to convince those around them to 
		 not let the opportunity pass by.  They prefer the start-up phase of a project or relationship, and are 
		 tireless in the pursuit of new-found interests. They are easily frustrated if a project requires a great 
		 deal of follow-up or attention to detail.  The roles in an outreach they enjoy most allow them to learn 
		 new things, meet new people, and quench their thirst for curiosity.  They get a great sense of  
		 accomplishment when they are helping others realize their own potential for growth.  
		</p>
		<p>
		However, ENFPs are not known for their ability to follow through with projects, so one who can remain 
		focused and diligent can usually find success in whatever outreach they choose to serve.  ENFPs generally 
		do not care for what may seem like trivially detailed and maintenance oriented activities and would rather have 
		flexibility and freedom than rigid order and legality.
