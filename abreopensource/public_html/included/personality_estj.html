        <h4> <h3> You're An</h3>
        <h4>ESTJ!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Guardian</h5>
 		<p>
         ESTJs are practical, realistic, and matter-of-fact, with a natural head for business or mechanics. Though 
         they are not interested in subjects they see no use for, they can apply themselves when necessary.  An 
         ESTJ looks for facts first and value the concrete first, but they do have a keen introverted sensing 
         ability.
		</p>
		<p>
		ESTJs have a strong sense of ethical standards and beliefs that they live by.  This makes them honest and 
		candid individuals, but can also inadvertently make them come of as coarse.  The reality is that an ESTJ 
		sees the world in terms of social order and will say and do what they have to do to maintain and promote 
		those ideals.  However, a SJ (Sensing and Judging) temperament is one who is always ready to give rather 
		than receive.  They hear Christ's call to care for the needy in especially practical ways.  They also 
		enjoy the ritual and ceremony of a faith filled life and have a great respect for elders of the church 
		and long held traditions.
		</p>
		<p>
		They like to organize and run activities. They are natural leaders who feel most comfortable when they
		 are in charge of a ministry or a task force within a ministry or church.  ESTJs make good administrators, 
		 especially if they remember to consider others' feelings and points of view, which they often miss.  
		 ESTJs use their gifts to take very logical approaches to tackling problems and they look for tangible 
		 results.  Within a ministry, the ST (Sensing and Thinking) gifts make them likely to be the most willing 
		 to take on any task that they are needed to accomplish.  Shutting out distractions, they take a practical,
		  logical approach to their endeavors. Realistic and responsible, they work steadily toward their goals.
		  The gifts of an ST allow them to remember experiences and organize them and apply them to a current 
		  challenge, which can keep a ministry that an ESTJ is in from making critical mistakes.
