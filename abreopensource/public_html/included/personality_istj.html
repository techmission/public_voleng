        <h4>ISTJ!</h4>

 <h5>"The Duty Fulfiller"</h5>
 		<p>
         ISTJs thrive on organization. They keep their lives and environments well-regulated. While very quiet, 
         they have very strong powerful sense of duty which shows in their actions.  They bring painstaking 
         attention to detail in their work and will not rest until a job is well completed.  They are often 
         dissatisfied with unresolved issues, whether in life or in fiction.  The STJ of their personality 
         explains why an ISTJ prefers an orderly ministry and prayer environment where they know their 
         responsibilities are laid out clear.  
		</p>
		<p>
		ISTJs are faithful, logical, organized, sensible, and earnest traditionalists. They earn success by 
		thoroughness and dependability.  Within a ministry, the ST (Sensing and Thinking) gifts make them 
		likely to be the most willing to take on any task that they are needed to accomplish.  Shutting out 
		distractions, they take a practical, logical approach to their endeavors. Realistic and responsible, 
		they work steadily toward their goals. They enjoy creating order in both their professional and personal 
		lives.  Despite their focus on their internal world, ISTJs prefer dealing with the present and the 
		factual. Keen observers of life, they weigh various options when making decisions. ISTJs are well-prepared 
		for most eventualities and have a good understanding of most situations. They believe in practical 
		objectives, and they value traditions and loyalty.
		</p>
		<p>
		An ISTJ holds a tremendous amount of respect for facts and numbers.  Because of this gift, an ISTJ may be
		 well suited to be in charge of the finances of a church or ministry.  ISTJs are more comfortable with 
		 routine as long as the routine proves to be effective and produces solid results, and tend to resist 
		 changes that they perceive to be unnecessary.  ISTJs also have a great deal of respect and appreciate for 
		 history and could be very valuable for a ministry who needs a documentation of its history.
		</p>
		<p>
		ISTJs generally do not find it as easy as others to share their emotions and things that they may have on 
		their heart.  However, a SJ (Sensing and Judging) temperament is one who is always ready to give rather 
		than receive.  They hear Christ's call to care for the needy in especially practical ways.  They also 
		enjoy the ritual and ceremony of a faith-filled life and have a great respect for elders of the church 
		and long held traditions.
