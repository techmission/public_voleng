 <h5>"The Nurturer"</h5>
 		<p>
         According to Myers-Briggs, ISFJs are interested in maintaining harmony in every aspect of their lives.
          They best understand and respond to that which is concrete and can allow them to maintain order.  
          They are genuinely warm and considerate people.  They believe the best in everyone and they their kind-hearted nature is a reflection of 
          their sensitivity to the feelings of others. Although quiet, they are people-oriented and very 
          observant. Not only do they remember details about others, but they observe and respect the feelings 
          and desires of others.  
		</p>
		<p>
		An ISFJ's keen awareness of the feelings of others is counterbalanced by their awareness of their own 
		feelings.  They may not express these feelings, but they are constantly processing their observations 
		of the people and world around them and reflecting about them in their own lives.  This is in part made 
		possible by an ISFJ's accurate memory, one of their strongest gifts.  Their memory combined with their 
		sensitivity to the feelings of others make them very gifted in serving to some of the most personal needs 
		of individuals.  It is not uncommon for people to get the feeling that an ISFJ knows them better than they 
		know themselves.  
		</p>
		<p>
		ISFJs have a strong set of values that factor into how they frame the world around them.  They tend to 
		have very concrete visions of how things should be and they will do their best to make their lives reflect 
		that.  They value tradition and respect systems and are comforted by security and the kindness of others.  
		As long as the world around them achieves those goals, they will likely be suspicious to change unless 
		they perceive it to be extremely necessary. Part of this is due to their SJ (Sensing-Judging) temperament, 
		which places a high value on order and respect elders and ritual. 
		</p>
		<p>
		ISFJs are doers who prefer a hands on approach to learning, as opposed to distant examination or having 
		someone explain a concept theoretically.  They shy away from roles than involve heavy analysis and will
		 gravitate towards callings that deal with the practical and concrete. Once they learn and understand 
		 their task within an outreach, the rest is history.  They are steadfast and meticulous in handling their 
		 responsibilities.  They will do the most routine and often undesirable work in a ministry as long as 
		 they find purpose and value in what they are doing.  Friends and family are likely to describe them as 
		 thoughtful and trustworthy. ISFJs take the idea of responsibility very seriously and will often become 
		 an individual that many people rely on because an ISFJ can be reluctant to tell a person in need "no." 
		  Because of this, they can often become overwhelmed with responsibility, but will bottle their stress 
		  or frustrations rather than burden those around them.  An ISFJ can avoid being taken for granted by 
		  expressing their own feelings in lieu of the risk of conflict with others.  People can support an ISFJ 
		  by verbally expressing their appreciation for their gifts.
