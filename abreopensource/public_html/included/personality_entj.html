        <h4> <h3> You're An</h3>
        <h4>ENTJ!</h4>

<div class="main_text">
 <h5>The Chief</h5>
 		<p>
              ENTJs focus on the most efficient and organized means of performing a task. This quality, along with 
              their goal orientation, often makes ENTJs superior leaders, both realistic and visionary in 
              implementing a long-term plan. ENTJs tend to be fiercely independent in their decision making, 
              having a strong will that insulates them against external influence. Generally highly competent, 
              ENTJs analyze and structure the world around them in a logical and rational way. Thinking is an 
              ENTJs greatest gift.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENTJs often excel in business and other areas that require systems analysis, original thinking, and an 
		economically savvy mind. They are dynamic and pragmatic problem solvers. They tend to have a high degree of 
		confidence in their own abilities, making them assertive and outspoken. In their dealings with others, they are 
		generally outgoing, charismatic, fair-minded, and unaffected by conflict or criticism. However, these qualities 
		can make ENTJs unintentionally appear arrogant, insensitive, and confrontational. They can overwhelm others with 
		their energy, intelligence, and desire to order the world according to their own vision. As a result, they may 
		seem intimidating, hasty, and controlling.  A great way for an ENTJ to avoid this is to not simply show confidence, 
		but to inspire confidence in Christians around them, especially those within their ministry.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENTJs tend to cultivate their personal power. They often end up taking charge of a situation that seems 
		(to their mind, at least) to be out of control, or that can otherwise be improved upon and strengthened. 
		Because of this, an ENTJ might be the best person to take over the leadership of a ministry in peril. 
		They strive to learn new things, which helps them become resourceful problem-solvers. However, since ENTJs 
		rely on provable facts, they may find subjective issues pointless.
		</p>
		<p>
		ENTJs appear to take a tough approach to emotional or personal issues, and so can be unintentionally viewed
		 as aloof and cold-hearted. However in actuality, the NT part of them only takes feelings into account 
		 when it seems appropriate for the situation.  This is because Thinkers believe that too much consideration 
		 for feelings can often lead to bias.  In situations requiring feeling and value judgments, ENTJs are well 
		 served to seek the advice of a trusted Feeling type.  They also enjoy challenging dialog that critically 
		 examines ideas, especially their own. In fact, ENTJs work best with other intelligent, creative and 
		 ambitious people whose gifts they respect.  This gift is also part of what makes an ENTJ able to provide 
		 forward thinking leadership to a ministry.
