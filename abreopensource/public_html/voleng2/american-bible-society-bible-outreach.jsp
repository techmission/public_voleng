            <h3>PARAGUAY: BIBLE OUTREACH TO YOUTH PROJECT</h3>
            <p>Although its population is one of the smallest in South America,  Paraguay has one of the largest populations of young people in the  region. Approximately 59 percent of its population is younger than 24.  Youth are becoming influential in Paraguay's transition to democracy,  which began in 1989.</p>
            <p>The Next Generation program, conducted by Sociedad B&iacute;blica Paraguaya  (SBP, Paraguayan Bible Society), is presenting the gospel to urban  youth in the Central, San Pedro and Alto Parana regions of Paraguay,  offering them the opportunity to experience God's Word and acquire a  biblical foundation to guide their actions. The project also equips  Christian youth with the spiritual resources they need to be agents of  change in their country and give local churches materials.</p>
            <p>According to the World Bank's country social analysis of Paraguay,  the large youth population in Paraguay poses risks as well as  opportunities for poverty reduction and sustainable development. It  argues that:</p>
            <p>&quot;This segment of the population is liable to make a significant  generational impact in the years to come - in politics, society and the  economy. Today, because of their upbringing in the context of political  and personal freedoms, they tend to be much more outspoken and  independent than earlier generations. With creative ideas, good  leadership, and adequate resources, the Paraguayan youth could offer a  great source of social energy and idealist commitment to initiate and  sustain a whole range of anti-poverty activities.&quot;</p>
            <p>In order to be effective agents of change, Paraguayan youth need  God's Word and discipleship training materials to prepare them for  leadership in all spheres of life. Training will also equip them to  make biblically based decisions as they strive to achieve their full  potential without being bound by their context.</p>
            <p>&quot;My friends and I walked many hours to take the bus to come [to a  Next Generation program] and we were expectant about this event,&quot; said  a 16-year-old resident of Curuzu de Hierro in San Pedro, Paraguay. &quot;But  now I can say that I have with me the most important person - now I  have God in my heart. In my baggage, I have a new Bible that I  received. I'm not afraid, even though I should be because my job is  [drug]-related. I need to look for any other job that does please God.  I'm new in this way, but I'm sure my current job is not pleasing [to]  God.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Next Generation program is reaching 50,000 urban youth, ages 15  to 29, with the transformative message of the Bible and mobilizing them  to take the gospel to their peers. Partnering with 130 volunteers from  local evangelical churches, Christian organizations and the Catholic  Church, SBP is updating a database of Christian youth who live in the  target areas to help conduct the youth festivals in three cities  featuring popular Paraguayan Christian artists, testimonies and the  preaching of God's Word. SBP also distributes portions at the festivals  and an additional 2,500 New Testaments in Spanish and Guaran&iacute;, the  official languages of Paraguay.</p>
            <p>Church volunteers are providing ongoing youth discipleship. Youth  who commit to becoming missionaries receive additional leadership and  discipleship training by SBP and will participate in SBP programs, such  as medical brigades, Bible Day and other distribution programs. They  may also get involved in outreach activities at local churches.</p>
