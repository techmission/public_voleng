<h3><p>Welcoming the Stranger through ESL Ministries</p></h3>

<p>As Rev. José Flores and his wife, Maria, were building their new church, <b>Iglesia Bautista Shalom</b>, in South Boston, they did a survey of the nearby housing project to assess the community's needs. Originally from El Salvador, Pastor José is particularly interested in reaching out to the more than 8,000 Hispanics now living in the area. His survey revealed three key needs: health insurance, representation to housing management, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.</p>

<p>"People don't know the language, and so they struggle to survive," said Pastor José. "We consider it our responsibility to do something for the community, and this is one of the doors that God has opened for us."</p>

<p>Welcoming the stranger is one of the great biblical mandates (Lev. 19:34-35), and as 25% of the population of Suffolk County are immigrants and 18% of people over the age of 5 speak a language other than English in the home, churches like Iglesia Bautista Shalom have been rising to meet the need.</p>

<p>The ESL ministry at ,<b>Hope Fellowship Church</b> in Cambridge germinated when Michael Dean, a minister of the Greater Boston Baptist Association who has been working with internationals for many years and who founded <b>Boston International Ministries</b>, approached Hope Fellowship's pastor Curtis Cook with the idea of offering classes.</p>

<p>The church agreed, and under the leadership of Hope Fellowship's City Coordinator Odoi Odotei, the program has seen impressive growth over its first two years of existence. "We've seen amazing growth in the numbers of students who are coming and we see students using English conversationally with us and with each other," Odoi observes. "But we also see them building strong relationships: people growing in connection with Bible study, through one-to-one relations [with their volunteer tutors], and with each other." The "real, sincere relationships" that intertwine students to their classes and the church community "build family."</p>

<p>Running for over twenty years, ESL classes at the <b>Church of the Holy Spirit</b> are a fundamental element of the church's mission. "The church sees itself as a missionary agent to respond to the community, and outreach is an integral part of that mission," explained Rev. Zenetta Armstrong. The church became aware of a growing number of Haitian immigrants in the community, and that many members of the congregation who were Haitian lacked strong English skills.</p>

<p>"I think the long-term goal is to help the students assimilate, to improve their opportunities for better jobs and a better quality of life," said Rev. Zenetta. "Speaking the language is an important tool." The longevity of the program lies in its continued relevance to community needs.</p>

<p><b>Range of Opportunities</b></p>

<p>As each ministry is unique in its origins, so are they unique in their styles and volunteer needs. Hope Fellowship Church offers both basic and intermediate English courses on Wednesday afternoons and Thursday evenings, and there are Bible studies for those with limited English proficiency an hour before each class.</p>

<p>Volunteers to help with both group teaching and one-on-one conversation sessions are always needed, and also with childcare during the classes. Advance preparation is given to teachers, and last summer Hope Fellowship hosted a workshop for ESL teachers provided by the <b>Baptist Convention of New England</b>.</p>

<p>Church of the Holy Spirit also offers two proficiency levels, and classes are twice a week on Monday and Wednesday evenings. The program's greatest challenge is finding volunteers who can consistently come on both days. "It's hard for students to get used to two different people," explained Rev. Zenetta. The program hopes to expand into areas such as computer training and GED preparation.</p>

<p>Pastor José feels that bilingual teachers at the beginning level are key. In screening interviews, several potential students commented that they had tried ESL classes at different schools, but stopped going after a lesson or two because the instructor couldn't speak Spanish. "The students felt they couldn't express themselves to the instructor," said Pastor José. This language requirement wouldn't apply to volunteers teaching at the intermediate or advanced levels, however.</p>

<p>Volunteers are also needed to help with childcare so that single mothers can attend, and it's possible that the mothers might be able to make a small contribution towards the childcare.</p>

<p>The ESL classes are an important form of community outreach, said Pastor José, because they demonstrate that "church is not just spiritual, but it has a practical use in their lives."</p>
