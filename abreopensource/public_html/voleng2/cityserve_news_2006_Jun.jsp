		<h2>Making a Difference One Day at a Time:</h2>
<h3><p>Organizations Offer Different Approaches to One-Day Projects</p></h3>

<p>Their stories sound the same. In 1991, a small group of busy young professionals meets over pizza to share their frustrations about the difficulty of finding volunteer opportunities that did not require an ongoing commitment. They decide to create a calendar for their friends of non-profit organizations that have such opportunities.</p>

<p>In 1992, a graduate student at MIT, herself a volunteer, discovers that others like her are looking for short-term projects that fit into their schedules. She begins organizing her friends into small groups and connecting them to local charities and social service agencies.</p>

<p>In 1995, a group of Gordon College students are challenged by a Christian conference to find a way for teenagers to glorify God by serving others. After extensive discussion with Boston church workers, they begin a summer youth program of service and outreach projects in the city.</p>

<p>In each case, what started out as an informal effort by a few friends to become involved in meaningful volunteer service in the Boston area has grown into a well-structured organization that oversees hundreds of volunteers in dozens of one-day service projects each month. <b>Boston Cares</b>, the largest of these groups, has a calendar of over 100 projects each month. <b>People Making a Difference (PMD)</b> has supervised over 2,500 volunteers in partnership with over 90 charities. <b>The Boston Project Ministries</b> now coordinates not only youth ministries, but also college and adult groups.</p>

<p>Organizations such as these provide volunteers in the Greater Boston areas with easy and structured ways to connect with opportunities. Those who are unsure of their callings can try out different projects and organizations without having to make a long-term commitment.</p>

<p>The projects are geared for people who lead busy lives but who wish to do something outside their nine-to-five schedules. Most projects are scheduled for a weekend day, although there are a few on afternoons and weeknights. A typical workday lasts from four to seven hours, and is designed to give the volunteer a sense of accomplishment without overtaxing their physical abilities.</p>

<p>Projects range from an hour at lunch break helping people sharpen their office and interview skills with The Work Place to planting native trees and mulching trails with the Friends of the Iroquois Woods. Volunteers can assist with ongoing activities such as tutoring students or recording books for the blind, or with one-time events such as picking up trash along the Charles River as part of the Earth Day Cleanup. PMD volunteers, for example, send donated books in response to letter requests from prisoners around the nation. (See photo.)</p>

<p>A further advantage, especially for new volunteers, is that you serve as part of a team that includes instruction and supervision by trained staff members from the group. They also provide necessary tools and equipment, as well as directions in advance so that you will know what to expect from the project and how to prepare for it.</p>

<p><b>Distinctive Methods</b></p>
<p>Despite the similarity of purpose, each group has a distinctive focus and method of incorporating new volunteers into its program. PMD promises "meaningful, hands-on work" and focuses on helping smaller, less well-known charitable organizations who might otherwise have difficulty finding outside help. No membership fee or training is required. Volunteers sign up for projects through the website, and receive a packet of orientation information for each project. Volunteers can also sign up for an e-mail bulletin announcing new projects, and contact Lori Tsuruda, executive director and founder of PMD, by phone if there are any questions.</p>

<p>This system aims at fostering "responsible, guilt-free volunteerism," emphasized Ms. Tsuruda. "You have to opt yourself in, and the only commitment we ask is that you work for the entire length of the [one-day] project."</p>

<p>The Boston Project's mission statement identifies them as "a community-based organization of committed Christian staff and volunteers whose faith inspires us to engage actively in service to people and organizations in underserved neighborhoods in Boston." Their Christian commitment gives shape to everything they do, although they do not limit their partnerships to explicitly Christian organizations.</p>

<p>A good way to get started with The Boston Project is joining a Saturday Service Day. This includes an introduction to the ministry, a Scripture-based devotional time, and 4 - 6 hours of service. To help cover administrative and equipment costs, volunteers are invited to make a donation of $10 - $20. They also have a need for college students and adults to do tutoring one or two afternoons a week in their Homework Center, a supportive study environment that welcomes any local child or youth.</p>

<p>Boston Cares is "dedicated to making volunteering accessible to everyone no matter what their personal or professional circumstances." Because of its size, Boston Cares is able to offer a large number of volunteer service opportunities each week. They require that interested persons become members by paying a small registration fee ($20 or less) and attending an hour-long orientation. You can sign up for this online (see below). Once you have done this, you begin receiving their monthly calendar of projects, and sign up for projects by contacting the project leader. The leader will then contact you individually with more details.</p>

<p>"Our goal with each project is to make people really feel that they made a difference," says Ms. Tsuruda, "and for the host organizations to feel that, too." Through organizations such as PMD, The Boston Project, and Boston Cares, making a difference has become all the more accessible, even for those with busy lifestyles.</p>
