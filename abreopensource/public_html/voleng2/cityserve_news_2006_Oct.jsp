		<h2>Mentors: Helping the Next Generation by Helping a Young Person</h2>

		<p>Boston may be known as the academic epicenter of the nation, but its own urban youth are failing to take advantage of the host of academic resources at their 
		doorstep. Several reasons account for the trend, which is becoming growing concern among urban ministries, but one major factor is the limited adult presence in 
		the lives of urban youth, advocates of youth mentoring say.</p>

<p>They add that adults who intentionally invest in the lives of children can encourage them to make choices that lead to improved academic progress and interest in 
pursuing higher education.</p>

<p>&quot;Mentors have proven very effective in counteracting this trend [toward educational apathy]-both by taking a vested interest in children, and by exposing them to 
the resources available to assist them in school,&quot; says John Pearson, President of <b>Big Brothers of Mass Bay</b>. He notes a survey conducted in Mattapan that revealed that 
80% of kids are growing up in single-parent homes, resulting in communities that lack the resources to be proactively involved with their kids. Though these children 
may have access to strong curricula, he says, they often fail to take advantage of the educational opportunities that can help them succeed in school-which is where 
the importance of mentors comes in.</p>

<p>&quot;If the mentor asks them about school, the mentor exposes them to all sorts of wonderful things, and when the kid says, 
'How can I be more like you?,' that opens 
the door for the mentor to say, 'I finished high school,' or 'I got a college degree,' and that's important. Every time an adult engages a child and gives them a 
positive experience, that's one for the good side. So [meeting] a couple of hours a couple of times a month can change an entire life history,&quot; Pearson explains.</p>

<p>Numerous ministries around Boston have recognized the need for mentoring relationships and have begun programs pairing adults and youth to help them achieve 
educational success. Commitments for mentors can vary from an intentional, one-on-one relationship in which the pair meets weekly, to a less structured classroom 
environment that requires a lesser commitment. The <b>Boston Higher Education Resource Center (HERC)</b>, for example, requires mentors to make an academic-year-long 
commitment to meeting one-on-one with a student to tutor them, take them on college visits, and provide guidance as they research and apply to colleges. Faith 
Partnership's <b>Science Certainly Is Fun Initiative (Sci-Fi)</b>, on the other hand, does not require mentors to attend each of the sessions in their 10-week program, 
but welcomes volunteers on an on-off basis to see if the mentorship a good fit for them.</p>

<h2>Why Mentors Are So Important</h2>

<p>Statistics show that kids who have adult mentors as role models make healthier decisions that ultimately affect their educational success. By showing an interest in
 children, mentors also help build confidence and resiliency in them, which is especially important for helping children tune out the negative messages coming from both 
 peers and popular youth culture.</p>

<p>&quot;It's important now more than ever before that we don't turn our children to the media or leave them to raise themselves,&quot; says Mia Roberts, Chief Operating Officer 
at the Big Sister Association of Greater Boston. &quot;We need to help them understand the experiences they're 
having. [Mentoring is] prevention as opposed to intervention.&quot;</p>

<p>The influence of Christian mentors is arguably the most profound because it can go deeper than mentorship, say those involved with Christian mentoring ministry. 
&quot;I 
define it as Christian discipleship. [Mentors] are volunteering not to feel good or because this may look good on the résumé, but out of a desire to serve the Lord because 
they see a need,&quot; says Chaletta Huertas, Mentor Program Coordinator at Boston HERC. 
&quot;There's a history of older people or people of greater power taking on and 
building up younger people. Jesus himself had 12 disciples. Look at Timothy and 
Paul. In Matthew 28 it talks about making disciples. We are continuing the 
history and obeying the command of the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Huertas points out, HERC is reaching out to a broad urban community, where everyone may not share the Christian faith or want it to be part of their educational 
program at HERC. &quot;We're clear that if you don't want faith to be a part of the program or mentoring relationship, we're not going to force it,&quot; says Huertas. But the door for 
sharing Christianity can still remain open. &quot;We're outreaching to communities that otherwise wouldn't set foot into a church. That's 
exciting because we have the opportunities to be ambassadors of the faith. We 
have seen students receive Christ and start walking in the Lord. We also have 
had the opportunity to plant seeds, which is also a great opportunity, because 
if these mentors didn't, who would?&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond playing a role of confidence builder and discipler, mentors can also help their international mentees deal with cultural adjustments. At the Dorchester HERC program,
 a ministry of the Dorchester Nazarene Compassionate Center (DNCC), mentors are there not only to help students reach their educational goals, but also to help them embrace 
 both Haitian and American culture. &quot;We're facing cross-culture problems as Haitians,&quot; says Rev. Pierre Zéphir, founder of DNCC. 
&quot;In terms of mentoring, it is very important to help young people to stay in the 
middle. We don't want them to lose Haitian culture.&quot;</p>
 
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>

<p>When it comes down to the decision of whether or not to mentor, the main 
factor to consider is time. Mentoring advocates unequivocally agree that 
effective mentoring is hindered if the mentor does not have the time to fulfill 
his commitment or meets inconsistently. Time has been a deterrent for many 
would-be mentors, but, as Pearson notes, &quot;if you like something, you find the 
time to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Those involved with mentoring attest that its positive impact on both mentor and child is all the motivation one needs to make the commitment and remain consistent. 
&quot;You'll be 
surprised that it's not a burden and how much of a joy it is,&quot; says Big Brother Kevin Crockett. 
&quot;In a way, you help the next generation just by helping a young person.&quot;</p>

<p>Mentors should also be good listeners and be able to devote quality time. They should not be quick to give an answer or attempt to 
&quot;fix things,&quot; but rather they should absorb 
their mentee's point of view and only expose them to other ways of thinking if necessary.  They do not have to meet any intellectual or socio-economic standards, nor should they 
expect that they need to be a &quot;perfect&quot; person in order to be a positive influence. And, of course, mentors should be willing to be a friend.</p>

<p>&quot;It is about friendship and relationship and having fun together and providing mutual support,&quot; says Roberts. 
&quot;If people think about who their friends are-it's the person who is there when 
you need them, reliably, predictably. What better way to leave a legacy than to 
help a child have fun in her life and to grow into a healthy adult human being?&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, mentoring is not just another &quot;volunteer gig,&quot; but rather an act of obedience to the call of Christ, says Alphonso Westley, Mentor Program Assistant at Boston HERC. 
&quot;It's like doing missions within your own community. To whom much is given, much 
is required. Don't hoard it. Give it out. You will only be blessed and enriched 
in your life if you pour out.&quot;</p>


<h2>To Be an Effective Mentor...</h2>

<ul><li>Be a person of integrity and of your word.</li>

<li>Remember past discussions and follow up.</li>

<li>Accept your mentees as they are, and make an effort to relate at their level.</li>

<li>Be positive.</li>

<li>Ask questions, but don't push for an answer.</li>

<li>Don't preach.</li>

<li>Encourage what your mentee is good at, but avoid insincere praise.</li>

<li>Be open to how God works through your relationships, now and in the future.</li></ul>
