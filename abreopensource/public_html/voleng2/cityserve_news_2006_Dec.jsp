		<h2>Sharing Joy through Holiday Service</h2>	
		
		<p>With its themes of giving thanks and celebrating the birth of Jesus, the holiday season can be an inspirational spur to starting or 
		deepening service to your community, getting to know your neighbors, and growing in your walk with Christ. Boston provides a plethora of 
		service opportunities. Before jumping in, it's helpful to consider how much time and what resources you're able to contribute. If you or 
		your group are new to service or to Boston, for example, or if you have limited time and resources, you may want to look at some entry-level
		opportunities to get your bearings.</p>
		<p>In this article, we take a look at some holiday service opportunities in Boston with varying levels of investment, from entry-level, to
		 requiring some resources and planning, to requiring high levels of resources and planning through organizing your own holiday effort. Whichever 
		 level is right for you, our hope is that the service that starts with the holidays grows to become a part of your lifestyle year-round!</p>
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>For those just getting started in service, getting involved in a familiar effort such as helping to serve a holiday meal is a great introduction. 
		The Wednesday Night Supper Club  of the Paulist Center offers &quot;hot, tasty nutritious meals of generous proportions&quot; to those who come to their doors.
		 Meals are served each Wednesday night at 6:00 p.m. and on the third Saturday of every month at 9:00 a.m. Certain Wednesday meals are set aside for 
		 Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, as well as other celebrations such as New Year's Eve.</p>
		<p>The advantage of on-going efforts such as The Wednesday Night Supper Club is that they are standardized and well-equipped to handle volunteers. 
		Their website comprehensively explains volunteer tasks so that you can orient yourself or your group ahead of time if needed, and also enables volunteer
		 applications. The Supper Club is also great for families or youth groups, as teens and children 12 and under can also serve.</p>

		<p>The holiday atmosphere of happily spending time together with friends and family can increase feelings of loneliness and depression in those who 
		are isolated. One organization which serves the elderly is Little Brothers 
		- Friends of the Elderly, which matches up friendly visitors to low-income
		 seniors on a regular basis, and also engages volunteers in special holiday visitations at times such as Easter and Christmas.</p>

		<p>Little Brothers was founded by Armand Marquiset in response to the poverty and isolation suffered by many elders in the aftermath of World War II 
		in Chicago. Little Brothers - Boston was established in 1979, and the organization opened a beautiful home for elders in Jamaica Plain in 2000. Their
		 motto, &quot;Flowers before bread,&quot; reflects the belief that &quot;people need love and connections as well as food,&quot; explained volunteer coordinator Jennifer Hight. Many elders have few or no friends or relatives 
		- through death or the transience of modern lifestyles - and human contact can be limited to 
		 agencies and senior housing complexes. &quot;So warm and meaningful contact, 
		even a one-time holiday visit, can bring comfort,&quot; Ms. Hight elaborates.</p>

		<p>Individuals can also get connected to a variety of volunteer opportunities through organizations like People Making a Difference (PMD), which 
		coordinates one-day projects that promote informed and responsible volunteering. Volunteers can sign up via the internet for hands-on projects year 
		round, and receive information about a week prior to the service day. Upcoming holiday opportunities include preparing and sharing a Thanksgiving meal 
		with low-income seniors and assisting with the set-up of the Salvation Army's Christmas Castle, an event which provides families with winter clothing, 
		food, and toys for their children.</p>
		<p><h2>Bringing Resources to Ministries</h2></p>
		<p>Feeling excited about getting even more involved in the community? The holidays also provide a wonderful chance to experience a higher level of service
		 by sharing resources such as musical talent or contributing Christmas presents.</p>
		<p>Rev. Neal Armandt, pastor of the South End Neighborhod Church of Emmanuel, sees their Adopt-a-Family-at-Christmas as a bridge to help volunteers 
		- especially
		 those from outside the city - connect with a local family in a personal way. Upon receiving a request from an interested volunteer or group, Rev. Armandt 
		 contacts a mother he knows, confirms the need and an interest in collaborating with the volunteers, and then serves as a liaison to help the volunteers and 
		 the family to connect. Building on the church's neighborhood outreach, he recommends families which have at least one member who's 
		&quot;giving their all to be a Christian.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;This is a personal kind of giving,&quot; said Rev. Armandt. &quot;The volunteers visit the family at their home [to deliver the presents] and meet the people they're
		 helping.&quot; To reach that point, Rev. Armandt sees his role as helping introduce the volunteers and the mother of the family, and then encouraging them to 
		 communicate directly. &quot;If the volunteers talk with the mother and ask her what they need, for example,&quot; he explained, 
		&quot;they are more apt to meet in person. 
		 By then, they're not complete strangers anymore,&quot; and the visit can go more smoothly.</p>
		<p>Even an apparently simple project like delivering presents can have possible negative consequences. For example, Rev. Armandt is careful to avoid feelings
		 of favoritism among families not receiving presents by requiring that the recipients keep the Christmas donations a secret and by choosing different recipient 
		 families each year. He also sets expectations from the beginning by clarifying with the family that this is a one-time event.</p>
		<p>Volunteers can also help at holiday events, such as the Angel Tree Christmas Party organized by Iglesia Bautista Shalom as part of their community outreach
		. A small church serving the Spanish-speaking community in South Boston, Iglesia Bautista Shalom also reaches out to their community through monthly events. 
		For the second year now, the church is continuing its support of Angel Tree, a program through Prison Fellowship that connects children who have a parent behind
		 bars with a gift. Last year, Rev. José and Maria Flores raised funds and collected presents, books, and winter clothing for over 50 neighborhood children.</p>
		<p>Volunteer groups are a key part of making that all happen, assisting by leading songs, playing a musical instrument, organizing simple party games, and 
		cleaning up. Volunteers who enjoy working with young people can continue to be involved, not only through holiday events, such as the upcoming celebration of
		 Three Kings Day in January, but also by helping with the children's church once a month. 
		&quot;It would be wonderful to have help!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Flores. 
		 &quot;Sometimes you feel like you are doing it all alone.&quot;</p>
		<p><h2>Organizing Your Own Holiday Effort</h2></p>
		<p>Churches or groups can also organize their own holiday efforts. Cambridge Community Fellowship Church (CCFC), for example, has organized the delivery of 
		Thanksgiving baskets to neighborhood families for the past several years.</p>
		<p>&quot;[This project] has allowed us to express our organizational gifts and serve together,&quot; said Gary VanderPol, co-pastor, 
		&quot;so it's really promoted fellowship 
		and meaningful camaraderie.&quot; Enabling as many in the church as possible to serve together has been a key aspect of the project. 
		&quot;I think the difference between 
		20% of the church participating and 80% participating has to do with accessibility,&quot; explained Francis Chen, who has been involved with the project for three years.</p>
		<p>Over the years, project organizers have worked to lower barriers to volunteer involvement, so that there are multiple and varied entry points for the entire 
		congregation to be involved in some way. One entry point, for example, is decorating the baskets after church, so that anyone interested in helping has only to
		 stay a few hours after the service.</p>
		<p>The project, though requiring extensive planning and resources, has blessed the congregation in many ways. 
		&quot;I think that people experienced God working in 
		a way that was surprising on the day of the project,&quot; reflected Mr. Chen. Sometimes people got lost, prayed, and then somehow found their way. Sometimes they had 
		trouble finding the family they were taking the baskets to, then miraculously ran into someone who had some key information.</p>
		<p>Pastor VanderPol also felt that the project has been &quot;an excellent avenue for those who haven't had much exposure to low-income neighborhoods to navigate 
		them, and actually talk to some real people.&quot; In recalling the difficulty volunteers had in finding families, Mr. Chen commented, 
		&quot;It's no coincidence that MapQuest doesn't show low-income buildings, 
		because nobody wants to visit them. Part of being poor is being 
		invisible.&quot;</p>
		<p>The very success of the project, however, can also be a disadvantage. 
		&quot;People feel like they've kind of done their thing to help the poor,&quot; observed Mr. Chen.
 		&quot;It doesn't translate into a lifestyle change.&quot; He'd be thrilled if congregation members who found the experience valuable went on to volunteer at food pantries 
 		or made donations to related organizations.</p>
		<p>Pastor VanderPol is excited about where the project is moving this year. Some members of the church, such as co-pastor Larry Kim, have deep neighborhood relationships. 
		The idea is to build upon these relationships by connecting many more members, who are often professionals or graduate students, with long-term residents, who are 
		often lower-income or whose children are &quot;at risk,&quot; by meeting for Christmas dinners. These dinners are held at people&quot;s homes in the neighborhood, with the church 
		providing the food.</p>
		<p>&quot;Although it may be smaller, it will contribute to long-term, cross-class relationships in our neighborhood,&quot; said Pastor VanderPol. 
		&quot;And the best thing is [that] it will be us eating together as equals, 
		[and] sharing hospitality as neighbors.&quot;</p>
