        <h3>TRAVELING ENGAGEMENT CENTER</h3>
        <p>The ABS Engagement Center has the unique ability to attract the  attention of young people, helping them identify with the need for  Scripture and become involved with furthering the work of making  Scripture available for all people.</p>
        <p>The Engagement Center is a display that travels across the United  States to encourage a new or renewed practice of daily Scripture, in an  effort to reform Christian character and compassion.</p>
        <p>We tell the story of our ministry through video panels,  &quot;trailer-length&quot; reviews of various ministry projects and other display  devices. One wall will be dedicated to people&prime;s handwritten  testimonies, while the nearby &quot;Share Your Story Now&quot; setup allows  others to capture their own testimony in real time. Calls to action are  facilitated by new mobile signup technology as well, and Bible  engagement resources are distributed.</p>
        <p>American Bible Society&prime;s interactive display is entitled &quot;Word of God Speak&quot;. The 20x20 design -- which can be scaled back to 20x10 â€“  shows how God speaks around the world through our ministry, and allows  those who visit the chance to share how God speaks with them.</p>
        <p>You will spend the majority of your time in the Engagement Center.  Thanks to your time and energy, all will experience the life changing  message of the Bible! You&prime;ll help ABS in its efforts to:</p>
        <p>Emphasize the importance of Bible Engagement 4+ (four or more) times  a week and excite the audience with new and innovative Scripture  resources made possible by American Bible Society.</p>
        <p>Join local church efforts to get congregants &quot;back to the basics&quot; by  calling members to a new or renewed practice of daily Scripture.</p>
        <p>Promote and support the church&prime;s Bible engagement program.</p>
        <p>Invite all attendees on an initial 7 day journey with Scripture that they can receive via their mobile telephone.</p>
        <p>Play a vital role in fulfilling the Society&prime;s 193-year-old mission to make the Scriptures available to people who need them, in languages  they can understand and are relevant, so that all may experience its  life-changing message.</p>
