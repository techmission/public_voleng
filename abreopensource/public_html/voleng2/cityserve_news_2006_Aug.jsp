<h3><p>Tips for Constructing Building Maintenance Projects</p></h3>

<p>Like a beloved sweater, an active church experiences a great deal of wear and tear of its premises, particularly if the building is an older one. 
<b>International Community Church</b> (ICC) in Allston, housed in a building built in the 1930s and home to seven churches and two organizations, has a warm 
welcome for individuals and groups interested in maintenance projects.</p>

<p>"Plumbers, carpenters, painters, floor sanders-we could use any of them in a big way," said ICC senior pastor Rev. Lorraine Anderson energetically
 while giving a tour of the extensive building. In the first-floor common room, Rev. Anderson pointed out the sink area and some of the chairs. The 
 sink had been painted last year, but frequency of use had already rubbed away most of the paint. Second-hand chairs quickly need to be re-upholstered 
 or replaced.</p>

<p>Extensive use of the building also creates opportunities for maintenance. ICC sponsors rock concerts for youth -some Christian, some Straight-Edge-
which results in high usage of an entryway and the bathrooms nearest the event hall, as well as the event hall itself, which is being rewired and could 
use some floor repairs. The building also has a fading baptistry. "I'd love to see a group come in and repaint [the wall mural] with a scene from the 
Charles River," Rev. Anderson said.</p>

<p>There are things to do year round, if not at the church, then by lending a hand with community clean-up or assisting neighbors.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army's <b>Jubilee House</b> in Dorchester also has a range of opportunities. Originally built in 1880, the house was the home of Jonathan 
and Jordan Knight of New Kids on the Block fame before joining the Salvation Army family in 1996. Jubilee House opened its doors under the leadership
 of Majors William and Susan Dunigan in 1997.</p>

<p>In addition to Sunday services and Bible studies, Jubilee House's ministries range from emergency and holiday assistance to summer enrichment programs
 to Brengle Academy, an alternative Christian middle school. The vitality of the ministry creates numerous opportunities for maintenance projects, from
  planting flowers and mulching beds on grounds covering more than an acre of land to helping refurbish the commercial kitchen and painting.</p>

<p>"Closing in our back porch would enable it to become a three-season space,&quot; explained Major Dunigan as she gave a tour of the building. They also 
have big plans for the old carriage house in the back, which would retain its shell but be completely renovated to include a pottery and office space.</p>

<p>"We also like to help the community, ministry groups as well as individuals," added Major Dunigan, "those who need painting or a porch built, for 
example, so we can help connect volunteers to needs beyond our own."</p>

<h3>Preparing for a Maintenance Project</h3>

<p>Although projects can vary between simple weeding and raking to extensive refurbishing, ministry staff and volunteers suggested a few tips for how 
volunteers can maximize their service:</p>

<ul><li><b>Get involved in the preparation process.</b></li></ul>
<p>Even a "simple" weeding and raking project can involve hours of preparation, from gathering equipment (gloves, rakes, weeders, waste bags) to drafting
 a timetable, to purchasing snacks, not to mention clean-up. Volunteers or project leaders can deepen their relationships with ministry staff by working 
 with the staff to find other ways of assisting the project:</p>

<ul><li>Make a site visit beforehand and familiarize yourself with the project details.</li>
<li>Bring your own supplies (gloves, equipment such as paintbrushes or buckets).</li>
<li>Purchase some of the supplies (paint, plaster, garbage bags) or rent equipment (sanding machine). The <b>Building Materials Resource Center</b> and <b>Building
 Materials Co-op</b> (see end of article) can help provide materials at low cost and offers periodic workshops on home repair.</li>
<li>Make use of team members with expertise in the project area to help plan and lead the project. This can be a great boon to ministry staff, who may
 not have much access to technical assistance.</li>
<li>Send some volunteers in advance to help prepare. With a large painting project, for example, two or three volunteers can help with the stripping, 
hole-covering, sanding, and priming.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Have a learner's attitude.</b></li></ul>
<p>Volunteers on one-day or half-day projects may not be aware of all the steps that take place before and after the project. A group may be asked to 
paint a certain way because an electrician is coming the next day and some rooms or areas have to dry by then. Follow the directions of the ministry 
staff or project leader.</p>

<ul><li><b>Be flexible and willing.</b></li></ul>
<p>Brian Corcoran, assistant pastor at ICC who has extensive experience in working with volunteers on construction and yard projects, praises a team of
 youths who tackled a basement cleaning. &quot;Some people respond with dismay: 'I'm stuck in this basement pulling out junk!&quot; he commented. 
&quot;But this group
  was just so psyched. They brought their boom boxes and had a 'let's go!' 
attitude, so it was really fun [to work with them].&quot;</p>

<ul><li><b>Work safe, work smart.</b></li></ul>
<p>The unexpected happens: volunteers can suffer from heat exhaustion or paint fumes, or fall off a ladder. Volunteers who are new to the task at hand
 especially need to be careful. Mr. Corcoran recalled a high school team who were helping paint a sidewalk. 
&quot;These two gals decided to do a little body
  painting and painted the heck out of each other,&quot; he explained. &quot;Unfortunately, this wasn't latex [which washes off easily], but a sealant with a 
  particularly good bond.&quot; The girls spent a long and painful time scrubbing the paint off. Ask the ministry staff for safety tips. Survey your team to 
  see who might have first-aid or CPR certification, and know where a first-aid kit is.</p>

<ul><li><b>Be sensitive to your context.</b></li></ul>
<p>Volunteers may be serving in a high-traffic area, and their behavior can impact clients, church members, and other visitors to the site. A 
&quot;grouchy&quot; volunteer might inadvertently hurt someone, cautioned Rev. Anderson, 
whose church also houses a counseling ministry. She recalled a team of Teen 
Challenge volunteers who sang worship songs throughout their painting project: 
&quot;They blessed everyone in the building!&quot;</p>
