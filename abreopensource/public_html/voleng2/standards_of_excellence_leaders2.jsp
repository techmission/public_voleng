<p><h1 align="center">Standards of Excellence for Volunteer Group Leaders</h1></p>

<p align="center"> Standards of Excellence were created to help articulate and clarify 
key elements that contribute to mutually successful volunteer experiences.</p> 


<p><i><h3>Our Pep Talk With You!</h3><br>
We are ecstatic that you are taking on the responsibility of a volunteer group leader. We understand the
thrills and challenges you will encounter, and hope that the rewards for you as a leader will be great.
It is exciting to see the impact that a short-term team of volunteers can have when added to the long-term
work of community leaders, churches, and social service agencies. Whether expressed or not, know that
your group of volunteers will be shaped by their service experience. Your leadership will be touching
many people’s lives!
Leading a group of people in the area of service work is a dynamic process. Things will constantly change.
People will approach service from many different perspectives and past experiences. Our best advice – be
flexible! This document is designed to promote best practices while helping you think through the
volunteer group experience from the perspective of being a team leader. And remember, you don’t have to
do it all alone. When appropriate, feel free to delegate. Without further adieu, here we go....</i></p>
<p><h3>What Do I Really Do?</h3></p>
<p><h2>KEY ROLES OF VOLUNTEER GROUP LEADERS</h2></p>
<ul><li>You are the <b>link</b> between your small group and the charities/clients with whom you
serve.</li>
<li>You are invaluable in <b>setting a vision</b> and <b>setting the tone</b> for all volunteers.</li>
<li>You <b>prepare, guide, and lead</b> your team through their volunteer experience.</li>
<li>You develop <b>meaningful relationships</b> with charities for the group, which make
volunteer work successful.</li>
<li>You <b>learn</b> about how your team can help meet the charity’s <b>broader needs</b>, thus
moving your group’s volunteer experience from good to excellent.</li></ul>
<p><i>How Do We Move from an Idea to Actual Volunteering?</i></p>
<p><h2>A STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH</h2></p>
<p><h3>Step 1. ASSESS</h3></p>
<p>There are many different people and internal and external factors that impact the volunteer
culture of your group, church, or company. <i>(In this context, we are specifically discussing volunteer
opportunities which reach out beyond your group’s own volunteer constituency such as teaching Sunday
School or volunteering to organize the company picnic.)</i></p>
<p>As you consider volunteering, here are some aspects to consider:</p>
<ul><li>Do we have a history of working with any service organizations we want to build upon?</li>
<li>Who influences where we serve (the Pastor, small group leader, group members)?</li>
<li>What type of project can we handle (scale of easy to more involved service projects)?</li>
<li>What type of service work are group members interested in?</li>
<li>How often would group members like to volunteer?</li></ul>
<p><h3>Step 2. CONNECT</h3></p>
<p>Once you have a sense of what you would like to do, you now need to connect with charities.
Our best advice – again, be flexible. Some charities have well-designed volunteer programs that
are easy to plug into. But other charities may not have a volunteer coordinator on staff, meaning
that hosting a team of volunteers is an extra responsibility they need to juggle. When contacting
a charity, be open to their needs. Express your group’s volunteer interest, but also leave room to
respond to the most pressing needs of the charity. Remember: Your goal as short-term
volunteers is to <b>help further the long-term mission of the charity.</b></p>
<p><b>Contacting charities can be challenging.</b> Try to schedule service projects two to three months
in advance, but recognize that it may take a great effort (and one to two weeks) for a charity to
respond to you.</p>
<p>Before you email or call, decide on a couple of good days and times when your group is
available to volunteer or if working with a larger audience, set a date with the charity first and
then sign up your volunteers.</p>
<p>Consider working with a volunteer organization like The Boston Project Ministries, which
effectively serves both volunteer groups and service organizations by setting up service projects
and taking care of many of the details. The Emmanuel Gospel Center helps to connect volunteers
and opportunities, and offers varying levels of support.</p>
<p><h3>Charity Communications</h3></p>
<p><b>Methods:</b> Email versus telephone</p>
<p>Introductory “talking points” for working together:</p>
<ul><li>Your commitment to learning about the charity and its needs</li>
<li>This is an opportunity to introduce the charity and its needs (volunteer, financial, professional, and
intangible support) to people new to the cause, clients, and community in a more meaningful,
hopefully ongoing, way beyond impersonal fundraising mailings</li>
<li>Your group will complete needed work and provide resources such as volunteer recruitment,
management, tools, materials, and other resources</li></ul>
<p>Introduce your group:</p>
<ul><p>1. What kind of group are you? <i>Professional colleagues, student, church, and if a group of younger people,
the number of adult chaperones that will volunteer along with them</i></p>
<p>2. What are the goals/purpose of this activity as it pertains to your group and the charity?</p>
<p>3. How many people from their group do you expect to participate and what are their ages? <i>50+, 25,
or 6 youths, teens, adults, and/or elders</i></p>
<p>4. What are your resources? <i>Skills, tools, materials, transportation, refreshments</i></p>
<p>5. Why do you want to volunteer?</p>
<p>6. What, if any, kinds of projects do you have in mind?</p>
<p><i>Weekday, weekend, physical, clerical, or fundraising work, throwing a party or organizing a cookout or
outing for clients</i></p>
<p>7. What is your timetable? <i>One to three months from date of first contact</i></p></ul>
<p><h3>Learn:</h3></p>
<ul><li>What does the charity really need?</li>
<li>Does it have seasonal needs?</li>
<li>How can volunteers make the most difference?</li>
<li>Are there specific requirements for age, criminal record checks, waivers, safety, abilities, etc?</li></ul>

<p><h3>Communication Tips:</h3></p>
<ul><li>Share the best times and best ways to reach you for normal business and emergencies.
<li>Describe your (and learn their) process for developing a volunteer project together, including how
far you are willing to extend your group and yourself for an under-resourced charity that may
have inadequate staffing and other resources to prepare totally for your volunteer group’s
participation.</li>
<li>Describe your role in this process.</li>
<li>Seek assistance if you receive no response within 1-2 weeks.</li>
<li>Make a site visit or trial run through.</li>
<li>Plan for contingencies. <i>What if…
A volunteer is too sick to participate? Who does s/he contact by when?
Your group must cancel or recruits less than the target number of participants, by when must they report so
and how must they handle it with the host charity and committed volunteers?
More than the target number of people want to volunteer? Will there be a creation of a backup list or
scheduling of an additional volunteer shift?</i></li></ul>
<p><h2>Step 3. PLAN FOR THE SERVICE PROJECT</h2></p>
<p>Thorough planning and preparation in advance is crucial for the successful engagement of
volunteers to assist a charity in carrying out its mission. The volunteer group leader should
understand several issues well before contacting a charity or recruiting volunteers.</p>

Ending time
Be as specific and detailed as possible in your planning:
• Compose a list of tasks and instructions if needed.
• Carefully communicate your expectations that group members must sign up/commit
individually to volunteer for each project by a specified deadline.
• The importance of starting/ending on-time (recommended “window” for arrival time, starting
within 15 minutes of advertised start time so not to penalize those who arrive on-time)
1. Why this is important: Respect for volunteers and charity staff.
2. Contingency plan if work will be incomplete.
• Communicate all important details to confirmed/signed up volunteers (things you would
like to know in advance): when they should arrive; clear directions to the worksite; with
whom they should check in; how long you expect them to work; when there will be
lunch/other breaks, etc.
• Make clear who they will be working with or serving (e.g., the young, elderly, homeless,
mentally or physically challenged, etc.) and what attitudes they should bring to the project.
• Check that the charity and you will have all necessary materials and supplies ready
3-7 days in advance.
Page 5 of 6
Step 4. COMMUNICATE
Your communications create a culture of service and market your volunteer opportunities as
well as inform and prepare participants.
Make sure your communications address the 5 W’s: Who, What, When, Where, and Why for
group members.
Communicate with your group and start signing people up about one month in advance.
Figure out the best way to let people know about the opportunity (verbal announcement,
bulletin, website, email, flyer, etc.). Be savvy and thoughtful about your recruitment techniques
since different audiences respond to different appeals. Your goal is to ensure an excellent
service experience, so also recruit people one-on-one – don’t wait for people to come to you.
Customary communication includes:
• Advertising opportunities/needs
• Personally asking individuals to help out
• Signing up committed volunteers
• Providing reminders, confirmations, and project details in advance of the service project
• Following up with volunteers after the service project is complete
Step 5. PREPARE
Before you serve, you need to prepare your group for their service experience.
This is an excellent time to use the Standards of Excellence for Volunteers. This resource will help
you and your group members examine your goals and motivations for serving along with
considering helpful attitudes that make for an excellent service experience.
We want to stress that when possible, it is important to have at least one group meeting with
team members prior to the day of the service experience. This meeting could include the
following:
• Overview of the day (start & end times, what we will be doing, what people should and
shouldn’t bring with them) AND an impact statement (what will be the outcome of your
service as a benefit to the charity).
• CityServe’s Standards of Excellence for Volunteers
• PMD’s Things to Keep in Mind When Working with Guests/Women
• Bible study on service
• Emergency instructions and contact numbers
Step 6. SERVE
Below is a helpful checklist for you to use on the Service Day.
Who Will Handle This? Activity
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Group Leader(s) Arrive at Host Organization
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Name & Phone# of Who Opens Host Organization:
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Organization of tools, materials, and work areas BEFORE volunteers

You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Orient volunteers
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Lead Self-Introductions
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Charity mission and its history, the nature of ongoing projects, and
short overview/tour of the worksite
Page 6 of 6
Who Will Handle This? Activity
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Scripture and prayer
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Describe schedule
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Describe overall goals for the project
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Explain and assign specific tasks with clear expectations
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Provide appropriate tools and materials for each task/site
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Demonstrate/train in tool use, safety, protocols, etc.
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Begin working
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Order lunches and arrange for pick up or delivery
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Break & Announcements
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Manage workflow
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Clean up and inventory tools and remaining materials
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Thank Volunteers
You / Another Volunteer / Host Org Project Closure & Reflection
As the project concludes, make some time to look back and evaluate the volunteer experience,
both with your volunteers and with the charity representative in order to plan/set up for the
next time:
• Did you accomplish what you had hoped for, your goals? What worked well and what
went poorly?
• How well was the job done? What still needs to be completed?
• Were there problems with engaging volunteers overall? Were there specific problems
connected with this particular host charity or particular volunteers?
• What do you need to do differently the next time, to a) make sure you have adequate
planning and resources; b) prepare and supervise the volunteers; c) obtain feedback from
them?
Step 7. CELEBRATE
Let this spirit of thankfulness pervade everything you do. You are building relationships, not
simply completing tasks. A successful volunteer project balances people and tasks. There are
many ways that this can be accomplished:
• Establishing a relationship with volunteers in advance of the project
• Mentioning as specifically as possible the impact of their contributions
• Getting to know their interests and motivations and personalizing the way you appreciate
them
• Praying for and with the volunteers
• Nurturing skills and passions, and mentoring future leaders
• Involving them in the decision making process for future efforts
• Create a physical reminder of what was accomplished (bulletin board, webpage, etc.)
• Sending thank you / appreciation notes
Your goal is to create an ever-expanding network of people passionate about serving others and
for them in turn to become advocates for service.

<p><i>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and 
estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? (Luke 14:28)</i></p> 

<p>Thorough planning and preparation in advance is crucial for the successful engagement of volunteers to assist your organization in carrying out its mission. The host organization should address a series of issues well before volunteers arrive.</p> 

<p><b>1. Goals and Motivations:</b> Why are we doing this? </p>
	<ul><li>Develop shared goals for the project and for the relationship.</li></ul> 
<p><b>2. The Tasks:</b> What needs to be done?</p> 
	<ul><li>What resources are needed for the project?</li> 
	<li>What specific tasks can volunteers be reasonably expected to accomplish?</li> 
	<li>What skill or proficiencies are needed for each task?</li> 
	<li>How many people are needed, maximum and minimum?</li> 
	<li>How long should it take to complete from set-up to clean-up?</li></ul> 
<p><b>3. Host Resources:</b> What are we able to supply for the project?</p>

	<li>Are we able to give adequate instruction and supervision for the volunteers?</li> 
	<li>How can we make the working conditions as pleasant as possible for the volunteers and clients served?</li></ul>
<p><b>4. Volunteer Resources:</b> What do they need to bring with them?</p> 
	<ul><li>Tools and materials</li> 
	<li>Type of clothing and footwear for safe task performance</li> 
	<li>Food and drink</li> 
	<li>Special skills or knowledge</li> 
	<li>Financial donation to project</li> 
	<li>Their own supervisors</li> 
	<li>Age limitations</li> 
	<li>Things they should not bring with them (cell phones, iPods, other valuables)</li></ul> 
<p><b>5. The Workday</b> (or longer period):</p> 
	<ul><li>Draw up a time schedule, allowing for introductions, prayer, training, work,breaks, meals, cleanup, and reflection.</li> 
	<li>Who will be responsible for making sure the work proceeds in a timely fashion?</li></ul> 
<p><b>6. Details:</b> Be as specific and detailed as possible in your planning.</p> 
	<ul><li>Compose a list of tasks and instructions if needed.</li> 
<li>Communicate all important details to volunteers in advance: how many people you can accommodate, when they should arrive, clear directions to the worksite, how long you expect them to work, when there will be lunch/other breaks.</li> 
<li>Make clear who they will be working with or serving (e.g., the young, the elderly, the homeless, the mentally or physically challenged) and what attitude they should bring to the project.</li> 
	<li>Have all necessary materials and supplies ready when project begins.</ul> 

<p><h2>II. Implementation </h2></p>

<p><i>Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of 
the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. (1 Cor. 15:58)</i></p> 

<p>When the work begins:</p> 

<p>1. Welcome the volunteers. Introduce yourself and express your gratitude 
for their participation.</p> 

<p>2. Communicate the heart and passion of your work. Explain briefly the 
purpose of your mission and its history, the nature of ongoing projects, 
and give a short tour of the worksite if necessary. Get people excited 
about becoming a part of it.</p> 

<p>3. Begin with Scripture and prayer, when possible, choosing an appropriate 
reading for the project. </p>

<p>4. Empower the volunteers to succeed </p>
<ul><li> Convey the particular goals you hope to meet </li>
	<li>Share the schedule verbally, and perhaps give written instructions as well. </li>
	<li>Provide clear expectations about their work. </li>
	<li>Provide guidance and contingencies for observing organizational boundaries. </li>
	<li>Assess volunteer skill levels and assign persons or groups to specific tasks. </li>
	<li>Give a demonstration and any necessary training and safety protocols for each task.</li> 
	<li>Make sure there is adequate supervision for all volunteers and staff available to answer 	questions during the day.</li> </ul>
<p>5. Build relationships</p> 
	<ul><li>Spend time with the volunteers while they work.</li> 
	<li>Work alongside them. </li>
	<li>Give positive feedback on their work: Verbally pat them on the back.</li> 
	<li>Have a time of reflection at the end of the day where they can express their observations 	and reactions to the work experience.</li> </ul>

<p><h2>II. Evaluation </h2></p>

<p><i>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
(2 Tim. 4:7) </i></p>

<p>Take some time to look back and evaluate the volunteer work: </p>

<p>1. Did you accomplish what you had hoped for, your goals? What worked well 
and what went poorly? </p>

<p>2. How well was the job done? What still needs to be completed? </p>

<p>3. Were there problems with engaging volunteers overall? Were there 
specific problems connected with this particular group? </p>

<p>4. What do you need to do differently to: a) Make sure you have adequate 
planning and resources; b) Prepare and supervise the volunteers; c) Obtain 
feedback from them? </p>

<p><h2>IV. Honor Volunteers</h2></p> 

<p><i>The members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable … and our 
less respectable members are treated with greater respect. (1 Cor. 12:22-23) </i></p>

<p>This attitude should pervade everything you do. You are not just completing 
tasks; you are building relationships. A successful volunteer project balances 
people and tasks. There are many ways that this can be accomplished: </p>

<ul><li> Establishing a relationship in advance with volunteers </li>
	<li>Praying for the volunteers </li>
	<li>Developing rapport at the beginning of the project </li>
	<li>Spending time in Bible study and prayer with them </li>
	<li>Working with them during the day </li>
	<li>Respecting their limitations as workers</li> 
	<li>Informal discussions at breaks and meal times</li> 
	<li>Eliciting their reactions at the end of the project</li> 
	<li>Sending thank you notes</li> </ul>
<p>Your goal is to create an ever-expanding network of personal support for your 
work as volunteers begin to catch your vision for ministry and share it with others. </p>
