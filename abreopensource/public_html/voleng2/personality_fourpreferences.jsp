  </table>


          
          
          <p>The four pairs of preferences&nbsp;are shown in the table to the right.</p>
          <p>Note that the terms used for each preference &nbsp;have specific technical meanings relating to the MBTI which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more&nbsp;<em>judgmental</em>&nbsp;or less&nbsp;<em>perceptive</em>.</p>
          <p>Nor does the MBTI instrument measure aptitude; it simply indicates for one preference over another. Someone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be correctly described as&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;extraverted: they simply have a clear&nbsp;<em>preference</em>.</p>
          <p>Point scores on each of the preferences can vary considerably from person to person, even among those with the same type. However, Isabel Myers considered the&nbsp;<em>direction</em>&nbsp;of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the&nbsp;<em>degree</em>&nbsp;of the preference (for example, very clear vs. slight).<a href="#cite_note-Manual-14"></a></p>
          <h3>Attitudes: Extraversion (E) / Introversion (I)</h3>
          <p>The preferences for&nbsp;<strong>extraversion</strong>&nbsp;(thus spelled in Myers-Briggs jargon) and&nbsp;<strong>introversion</strong>&nbsp;are sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<em>attitudes</em>. Briggs and Myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior, action, people and things (<em>extraverted attitude</em>) or the internal world of ideas and reflection (<em>introverted attitude</em>). The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator sorts for an overall preference for one or the other of these.</p>
          <p>The terms&nbsp;<em>extravert</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>introvert</em>&nbsp;are used in a special sense when discussing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their level of energy and motivation tends to decline. Conversely, those who prefer introversion become less energized as they act: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. People who prefer introversion need time out to reflect in order to rebuild energy.</p>
          <p>The extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, and the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. There are several contrasting characteristics between extraverts and introverts: extraverts are action-oriented and desire breadth, while introverts are thought-oriented and seek depth. Extraverts often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverts prefer more substantial interaction.</p>
          <h3>Functions: Sensing (S) / iNtuition (N) and Thinking (T) / Feeling (F)</h3>
          <p>Jung identified two pairs of psychological functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The two&nbsp;<em>perceiving</em>&nbsp;functions, sensing and intuition</li>
            <li>The two&nbsp;<em>judging</em>&nbsp;functions, thinking and feeling</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to the Myers-Briggs typology model, each person uses one of these four functions more dominantly and proficiently than the other three; however, all four functions are used at different times depending on the circumstances.</p>
          <p><strong>Sensing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>intuition</strong>&nbsp;are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions. They describe how new information is understood and interpreted. Individuals who prefer&nbsp;<em>sensing</em>&nbsp;are more likely to trust information that is in the present, tangible and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the five senses. They tend to distrust hunches that seem to come out of nowhere. They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer&nbsp;<em>intuition</em>&nbsp;tend to trust information that is more abstract or theoretical, that can be associated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking a wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future possibilities. They tend to trust those flashes of insight that seem to bubble up from the unconscious mind. The meaning is in how the data relates to the pattern or theory.</p>
          <p><strong>Thinking</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>feeling</strong>&nbsp;are the&nbsp;decision-making&nbsp;(judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both used to make rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer&nbsp;<em>thinking</em>&nbsp;tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer&nbsp;<em>feeling</em>&nbsp;tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved.</p>
          <p>As noted already, people who prefer thinking do not necessarily, in the everyday sense, &quot;think better&quot; than their feeling counterparts; the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming to decisions (and, in any case, the MBTI assessment is a measure of preference, not ability). Similarly, those who prefer feeling do not necessarily have &quot;better&quot; emotional reactions than their thinking counterparts.</p>
          
          <h4>Dominant Function</h4>
          <p>Although people use all four cognitive functions, one function is generally used in a more conscious and confident way. This dominant function is supported by the secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the<em>shadow</em>.<a href="#cite_note-Myers-0"></a></p>
          <p>The four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.</p>
          
          <h3>Lifestyle: Judgment (J) / Perception (P)</h3>
          <p>Myers and Briggs added another dimension to Jung's typological model by identifying that people also have a preference for using either the&nbsp;<strong>judging</strong>&nbsp;function (thinking or feeling) or their <strong>perceiving</strong>&nbsp;function (sensing or intuition) when relating to the outside world (extraversion).</p>
          <p>Myers and Briggs held that types with a preference for&nbsp;<em>judgment</em>&nbsp;show the world their preferred judging function (thinking or feeling). So TJ types tend to appear to the world as logical, and FJ types as empathetic. According to Myers,&nbsp;judging types like to &quot;have matters settled.&quot; Those types who prefer perception show the world their preferred&nbsp;<em>perceiving</em>&nbsp;function (sensing or intuition). So SP types tend to appear to the world as concrete and NP types as abstract. According to Myers,<a href="#cite_note-Myers-0"></a> perceptive types prefer to &quot;keep decisions open.&quot;</p>
          <p>For extraverts, the J or P indicates their&nbsp;<em>dominant</em>&nbsp;function; for introverts, the J or P indicates their&nbsp;<em>auxiliary</em>&nbsp;function. Introverts tend to show their dominant function outwardly only in matters &quot;important to their inner worlds.&nbsp;For example:</p>
          <p>Because ENTJ types are extraverts, the J indicates that their&nbsp;<em>dominant</em>&nbsp;function is their preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). ENTJ types introvert their auxiliary perceiving function (introverted intuition). The tertiary function is sensing and the inferior function is introverted feeling.</p>
          <p>Because INTJ types are introverts, the J indicates that their&nbsp;<em>auxiliary</em>&nbsp;function is their preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). INTJ types introvert their dominant perceiving function (introverted intuition). The tertiary function is feeling, and the inferior function is extraverted sensing.</p>
          
          <h3>Whole type</h3>
          <p>The expression of a person's psychological type is more than the sum of the four individual preferences, because of the way in which the preferences interact through&nbsp;<em>type dynamics</em>&nbsp;and <em>type development</em>. Descriptions of each type can be found on the&nbsp;Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation&nbsp;website. In-depth descriptions of each type, including statistics, can be found in the MBTI Manual.<a href="#cite_note-Manual-14"></a></p>
