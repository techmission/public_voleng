	these are the rules according to RFC 822 @ http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/
	local-part + "@" + domain
	local-part is any atom (defined as any ASCII Char 0-127 EXCEPT Chars 0-32,34,40,41,44,58-60,62,64,91-93,127)
		or any quoted string (with DBL Quotes char(34)) containing any ASCII char 0-127 EXCEPT chars 13,34,92, this quoted string can also be empty
		or series of quoted strings and/or non-quoted strings (also called atoms) separated by a period
		this does not take into consideration any "quoting" of characters allowed or comments
	"@" is just what it is a single @ sign
	domain is any atom (defined as any ASCII Char 0-127 EXCEPT Chars 0-32,34,40,41,44,58-60,62,64,91-93,127)
		or a domain-literal (defined as a string enclosed in brackets [ ] with any ASCII char 0-127 EXCEPT 13 and 91-93, this enclosed string can also be empty)
		this does not take into consideration any "quoting" of characters allowed or comments
	We are not strictly adhering to the standard when it comes to domain-literals, we will assume the email either ends in a domain-literal, 2-4 letters, or 1-3 numbers
